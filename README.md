# Graph Bisection

An implementation of the graph bisection algorithm using label propagation (2-approximation for the MAX-CUT problem).
There are three versions of the algorithm:
- sequential
- distributed with all to all communication
- distributed with peer-to-peer communication

The algorithms are implemented in C using MPICH library.
